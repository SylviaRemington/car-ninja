<!-- CAR NINJA GAME HTML -->

<!-- Instructions about how to play the game are included in your app. -->
<!-- Include win/loss logic and render win/loss messages in HTML. The game you chose must have a win/lose condition. -->
<!-- All images on the site have alt text. -->
<!-- No text is placed on top of an image in a way that makes the text inaccessible. -->
<!-- The game is coded using proper indentation. -->

<!-- First create the screen/grid where cars move and have start button there.
Then if have time create the other screens.
Create the grid.
Then create a start game button, an instructions button, a pause button, 
an end game button, and also a place where points can be earned

Also, created a data area where I can put car comments 
and also audio sounds and funny comments. -->

<!-- AI suggestion for me improving this code. Need to look into this:
Image Optimization:
Consider adding loading="lazy" to game images
Add width and height attributes to maintain layout

Future-Proofing:
Add empty <div id="countdown"></div> for your "3-2-1" timer
Consider adding data- attributes for game state (e.g., data-score="0")

INFO ABOUT ADDING LAZY TO IMAGES FOR GAMING:
What loading="lazy" Means for Images
The loading="lazy" attribute is a performance optimization that tells the browser to delay loading an image until it's about to appear in the viewport (the visible part of the webpage). Here's why and how to use it in your game:
Key Benefits for Your Game
Faster Initial Load
Images load only when needed (e.g., when the player reaches the gameplay screen).
Reduces data usage and speeds up page startup.
Better Performance
Prevents loading all images (cars/potholes) upfront, which can slow down older devices.
Smoother Experience
Avoids stuttering when many images load simultaneously.-->
