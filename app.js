// CAR NINJA GAME JS

//The code in the app adheres to coding conventions covered in lessons, 
// like using plural names for arrays.

// Render the game in the browser using the DOM manipulation techniques 
// demonstrated in lecture.

// The game is coded using proper indentation.

//!! MAIN FOCUS IS ON MVP AND GETTING GAMEPLAY SCREEN TO WORK

console.log('JS LINKED AND WORKING');

/*-------------------------------- Constants --------------------------------*/
//for creating a new element and saving it in memory
//e.g. const clickToAddParagraphButton = document.createElement('button')



/*-------------------------------- Variables --------------------------------*/

let pointsEarned = '';


/*------------------------ Cached Element References ------------------------*/
//Things I want to select so I can do something with them.
//e.g. const button = document.querySelector('button');
//e.g. const title = document.querySelector ('h1');

//button to start game
//button to adjust game speed
//button for fun facts --randomized
//selecting points earned area (might not be a button but something else)
//click on cars to create getting points (can you create a car as a button? Or an image?)



/*-------------------------------- Functions --------------------------------*/
//What it should do... e.g. text in the title should update
//e.g. function updateTitle(){
        // title.textContent = "Updated"}; 

//Create a function that connects to a different page to start the game
//Create a function that randomizes fun facts
//Create a function to add points earned
//Create a function that gives you instructions when you click on the Basic Instructions button




/*----------------------------- Event Listeners -----------------------------*/
//e.g. button.addEventListener('click', updateTitle); //when you click on the button, it will update the title

//listen for clicks to create instructions
//listen for clicks to start game //Do they all have to be separate event listeners?
//listen for click to adjust game speed







//The part showing starting and ending game
//The part showing the "playing of the game/gameplay"
//Make subfunction categories - like button functions/ ninja functions/ word bubble functions/ sound functions

CHANGING BUTTONS TO SCORE DISPLAY - FOR POINTS EARNED & TRIES LEFT
        <button id="points-earned" class="buttons">Points Earned</button> <!-- This Points Earned Button might be taken away, and instead use a SCORE DISPLAY or SCORE COUNTER -->
        <button id="tries-left" class="buttons">Tries Left Before Gameover</button><!-- This Tries Left Button might be taken away, and instead use a SCORE DISPLAY or SCORE COUNTER -->
        <!--Grok ai told me about better practices to use <span>s(class="display")for score and live displays as they are not interactive.
         <span id="points-earned" class="display">Score: 0</span>
        <span id="tries-left" class="display">Lives: 3</span> -->

When making a simple video game, using a score display (like text on the screen) instead of buttons is better because:

Buttons are for player input – Buttons are meant to be clicked or pressed by the player (like "Start" or "Pause").

Scores update automatically – The score changes quickly as the player earns points, so displaying it as text is cleaner and faster.

Less confusing – A button implies you can interact with it, but the score is just information.
