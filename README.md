Car Ninja Game ---- Ready to ninja chop some cars??!? Have all the cars around you been driving too slowly in the fast lane, lately? And you're done with it?! If so, Car Ninja is for you!

README Requirements:

1. Screenshot/Logo: A screenshot of your app or a logo.

2. Your game's name: Include a description of your game and what it does. Background info about the game and why you chose it is a nice touch.

Game Name: Car Ninja

Description:

Background Info: I chose to create this game because (1) Fruit Ninja is FUN! Who doesn't like to slice random fruit and see it splat everywhere, without the real-life cleanup?! Also, I wanted to create a game that is similar but with cars because when I drive in the United States, the drivers are horrible and like to drive slowly in the fast lanes, and also don't abide by driving rules. I thought it would be fun to create a game where you could "slice" a car that's a poor driver (since you can't do it in real life. hehe). I figure this new rendition could be the solution for "road rage". Just play Car Ninja, and you won't want to do crazy things on the real road! lol

7. //If time, add sections including: Features, Screenshot/Images/Visuals Descriptions,MVP Requirements, Early Concept/Ideas, Process aka Build/CodeProcess, Known Issues & Bug Solves, Edge Cases Covered, and also disclaimer since I'm re-creating a game that is already big "Fruit Ninja". Somewhere state that this is educational, for learning class purposes, and is from a ninja-movie-watching-fan!
