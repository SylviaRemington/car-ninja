# Car Ninja!

Ready to ninja chop some cars??!? Have all the cars around you been driving too slowly in the fast lane, lately? And you're done with it?! If so, Car Ninja is for you!

## Description & Background Info
Car Ninja was originally inspired by the game Fruit Ninja! I had big plans to create something almost identical to Fruit Ninja; except instead of slicing fruit, you'd be clicking on cars and watching them break apart!

Background Info: I chose to create this game because (1) Fruit Ninja is FUN! Who doesn't like to slice random fruit and see it splat everywhere, without the real-life cleanup?! And (2) I wanted to create a game that is similar but with cars because when I drive in the United States, the drivers are horrible and they like to drive slowly in the fast lanes, and also don't abide by driving rules. I thought it would be fun to create a game where you could "slice" a car that's a poor driver (since you can't do it in real life. hehe). I figure this new rendition could be the solution for "road rage". Just play Car Ninja, and you won't want to do crazy things on the real road! lol

Ultimately, in its current iteration, it is purely a game in which you click on cars to score points. You have 15 seconds to click on 17 cars to win! Otherwise, you lose. It is very similar to Whackamole except cybertrucks are randomly generated and you click on them. Due to the fact that I'm a beginner coder, this is the best I can do at this point. I, however, still plan on continuing my quest to create this game exactly as I intended with rogue potholes (to lose lives), sound effects, random comic-strip-looking word bubbles that come from the cars, and funny comments generated by a ninja and by the cars.

7. //If time, add sections including: Features, Screenshot/Images/Visuals Descriptions,MVP Requirements, Early Concept/Ideas, Process aka Build/CodeProcess, Known Issues & Bug Solves, Edge Cases Covered, and also disclaimer since I'm re-creating a game that is already big "Fruit Ninja". Somewhere state that this is educational, for learning class purposes, and is from a ninja-movie-watching-fan!

8. Ahas & Awarenesses from this project while researching code, coding, and fixing bugs

CONSISTENT TEXT - In my data.js section, inside Objects, using consistent text for the "key" in key: value pairs was especially eye opening for me, regarding ease of use later on in coding... Especially in JS iterating over arrays and objects (e.g. forEach, for...loop). Creating consistent text makes code more reusable and easier to maintain.

Example: 

MY INITIAL VERSION:
const carComments = [
    { comment1: "Oh noooo! I was driving to slow!" },//AI is saying I need consistent keys here and to name them all "text"/ask about this
    { comment2: "" },
    { comment3: "" },
    { comment4: "" },
    { comment5: "" } //Took off trailing comment here. Even though comma works with modern JS, doesn't work for older environments.
];

CORRECTED VERSION FOR MORE USEABILITY:
const carComments = [
    { text: "Oh noooo! I was driving to slow!" },//AI is saying I need consistent keys here and to name them all "text"/ask about this
    { text: "" },
    { text: "" },
    { text: "" },
    { text: "" } //Took off trailing comment here. Even though comma works with modern JS, doesn't work for older environments.
];
